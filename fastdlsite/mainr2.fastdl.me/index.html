<title>You're in a bar. Your fourth beer tastes as bad as the first. You look over at the guy smoking in the corner, alone at a table. He glances over and then matches your gaze. He's here more often than you. You wonder what's the point of living if you're doing nothing with your life, like him. You nod. He nods back. Another sip of beer leaves another sour taste in your mouth. Work sucked today, as it usually does. The ache in your back is more noticeable than usual. You know you need to quit because all the heavy lifting will only make it worse. Just need to save up a bit more... Just need to get out of this town... You decide it's been long enough and decide to leave. You tip the barkeeper, Carol, and she tells you to get home safe. You remember her name because it's your mother's. You're not drunk, you assure yourself, as you fumble with your keys to get into your car. It's nothing you haven't done before after all. Starting down the road, you end up with some fucker behind you with their high-beams on. You slow down and get them to pass you. You can feel a migraine coming on. You can't handle bright lights at night very well. Being buzzed doesn't help either. You're coming up on that bridge. You know, the one you almost slammed into when you were learning to drive. How long ago was that now? The prick in your head distracts you from that. What if you... just turned the wheel a little too much? Maybe... it'd be alright? To see? To take a break? ...You give the wheel a small tug. Closing your eyes you think about how nice it'd be if you couldn't feel your head right now... if you didn't feel at all... You feel a jolt and soon lose sense of gravity. You hold your eyes closed tighter. Was this the right choice? Thump. Does it really matter? You were never really a religious person... but you wonder if you'll meet God. You feel your legs submerged in water now. Cold. Just a little longer now... You know it'll be a little uncormfortable... hopefully not too much... You think about your mother again. Her apple pies were al-- You can't get a breath anymore. It hurts... it's cold... it hurts... it's cold...</title>

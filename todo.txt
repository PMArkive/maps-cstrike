Figure out what to do with:
	bhop_winter_fix,2688471,822439,3d19b027307bbce87b8d52bd4b10c884858df0d3
		- This ISN'T bhop_winter_fix. It's bhop_winter with a fucked skybox but not fullbright
	bhop_sloop
		- It has a retexture somewhere...
	bhop_sky_6xl,27040497,9583332,c14e9d58dcd4093ed65fd92c0eebf0919ce90d7c
		- Adds lighting so it's not fullbright
	bhop_platinum_fix
		- Two different ports
	bhop_whatisthis(659d99e10744df4cfa78db91ded72fd726dd09ce) & bhop_energy/bhop_whatisthis(200b1abd70bf0dc6868beaa817d8c5ea9f5e52a9)
		- Two different ports of bkz_whatisthis. Use bhop_whatisthis (200b1..) as the name & remove energy?
	kz_crate_delight
		- Two different ports. Might need to be packed.
	kz_genesis
		- Two different ports. One needs to be packed
	kz_kzro_communityblock
		- One has a teleport destination for gate3_d. And the other has a big filesize. Not sure what the differences are...
	kz_mix_multitude
		- varying amount of unpacked-ness
	kz_azlyco
		- no textures :(
	surf_canisius
		- current one on gamebanana should be the "right" one?

Other things I'll forgot I placed in this file but I'm cleaning out my discord notes channel:
	- recheck renamed maps
	- delete known bad or corrupted maps (like bhop_fuji,4096000,...)
	- do something about bh_aztec_d_x8 & bh_aztec_8xl having the same hash or something...
	- I had surf_zoomathon and surf_flatliners noted for some reason... find out why...
